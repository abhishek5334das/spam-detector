# Description 
 Spam messages refer to  detect unsolicited, unwanted and virus-infected emails and prevent those 
messages from getting to a user's inbox and protect against fraud. These messages are usually promotional and peculiar in nature. Thus, it is possible for us to build ML/DL models that can detect Spam messages.
